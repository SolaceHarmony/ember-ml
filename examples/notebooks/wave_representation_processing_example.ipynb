    "This notebook illustrated how data can be represented as harmonic waves and processed within Ember ML. By mapping embeddings to harmonic parameters and generating wave sequences, we create a unique data representation. These wave representations can then be processed by suitable neural network layers. This approach, combined with Ember ML's backend-agnostic nature, opens up possibilities for exploring novel wave-based neural architectures."
