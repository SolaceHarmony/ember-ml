## Important Reminders for Implementation

1. **Use CLI Tools**: Always use CLI tools to check implementations in site-packages. This will help you understand the structure and organization of the original code.

2. **Separate Classes**: Follow the same pattern as ncps.torch and separate different classes into different files. This makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand.

3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test each component thoroughly, especially with different backends. Make sure that the same code works correctly with PyTorch, NumPy, and MLX backends.

4. **Reference Existing Tests**: Look at the existing tests in the `./testing` folder for examples of how to write tests for EmberHarmony components.

5. **Backend Agnosticism**: Always use ops functions instead of direct backend functions. This ensures that the code works with all backends.

6. **Documentation**: Document all components thoroughly, including examples of how to use them with different backends.

7. **EmberHarmony Only**: Never use numpy, torch, or keras directly. Always use emberharmony and grow emberharmony as needed.

8. **Research xLSTM**: Use Browser and GitHub to research xLSTM implementation and ensure it's properly replicated in EmberHarmony.

## Conclusion

This task list provides a detailed roadmap for implementing the control theory integration plan. By following this list and keeping the important reminders in mind, we can ensure that all necessary components are created and properly integrated into the EmberHarmony framework.
