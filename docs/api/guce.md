# Grand Unified Cognitive Equation (GUCE)

The Grand Unified Cognitive Equation (GUCE) is a theoretical framework that treats the universe and all matter and energy within it as a neural system. It integrates multiple unified theories to create a learning system that reframes fundamental physical concepts in cognitive terms:

- Energy as stochastic exploration
- Time as query and answer
- Matter as long-term storage
- Gravity as literal weights

## Wave Dynamics Approach

The GUCE framework moves away from traditional liquid neuron components toward a purely harmonic, causally structured neural system. This approach aligns with Eva Miranda's work on geometric quantization, symplectic structures, and wave mechanics, creating a Hamiltonian-inspired cognitive model that treats cognition as a dynamical flow on a structured phase space.

### Theoretical Shift: From Liquid Neurons to Harmonic Wave Dynamics

#### Key Conceptual Updates:

1. **Liquid Neurons → Continuous Wave Propagation**
   - Instead of differential equation-based neuron activations, cognition is modeled as a propagating wave function
   - The neural state is no longer node-based but a spatiotemporal field governed by harmonic oscillations

2. **Geometric Quantization and Symplectic Flow**
   - Learning is interpreted as a deformation of a phase-space manifold
   - The learning process is a geometric transformation rather than a purely statistical update

3. **Boltzmann-Hebbian Fusion as Wave Interference Mechanism**
   - Hebbian updates are now resonance patterns in the wave field
   - Boltzmann-like stochasticity emerges from wave superposition and constructive/destructive interference

## The Grand Unified Cognitive Equation

The wave-based cognitive evolution equation is formulated as:

$$S = \int_0^T \int \sum_{i=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha i} \Big[ \Psi(x_i, t) + \tilde{W}_{ij} \cos(\theta_{ij}) - \frac{1}{2} \tau (\partial_t h_i(x_i, t))^2 \Big] dx dt$$

Where:
- $\Psi(x_i, t)$ represents harmonic wave encoding
- $\tilde{W}_{ij} \cos(\theta_{ij})$ represents the Hebbian connection strength
- $\tau (\partial_t h_i(x_i, t))^2$ represents the temporal dynamics

The equation consists of the following components:

1. **Harmonic Wave Encoding**
   - Encodes neural inputs as propagating waveforms
   - The amplitude, frequency, and phase represent encoded information
   - Inputs are no longer discrete—they evolve as continuous oscillatory fields

2. **Symplectic Flow**
   - Governs how information propagates and transforms in cognition
   - Analogous to Hamiltonian mechanics, ensuring structured phase-space evolution
   - Inspired by Miranda's geometric quantization work, ensuring that cognitive transformations are symplectic rather than arbitrary

3. **Boltzmann-Like Probabilistic Factor**
   - Represents stochastic emergent behavior (akin to Boltzmann Machines)
   - Allows for probabilistic inference & categorization via wave interference patterns
   - Introduces non-deterministic cognitive exploration, much like quantum-inspired cognitive models

### Key Equation Components and Their Interactions

#### 1. Temporal Evolution and Wave Harmonics

The temporal evolution of neuron states is governed by:

$$\partial_t h_i(x_i, t) = \frac{1}{\tau} \big[ \Psi(x_i, t) - h_i(t) \big] + \eta \sum_j W_{ij} \Psi(x_j, t)$$

This equation couples harmonics to dynamics in several important ways:

1. **Coupling Harmonics to Dynamics**:
   - By directly subtracting $h_i(t)$ from $\Psi(x_i, t)$, we ensure the harmonic wave function influences the state evolution, but with a decay governed by $\tau$
   - This allows neurons to "settle" into stable states over time

2. **Learning Through Interactions**:
   - The term $\eta \sum_j W_{ij} \Psi(x_j, t)$ introduces Hebbian-like learning
   - A neuron's state is influenced by the waveforms of its connected neighbors
   - The learning rate $\eta$ controls how strongly these connections modulate the dynamics

3. **Time Constant Stability**:
   - The inclusion of $\tau$ ensures that the system remains stable, even when faced with chaotic or noisy inputs

#### 2. Convergence of the Infinite Summation

The infinite summation $\sum_{i=1}^\infty$ in the grand unified equation is controlled by an exponential decay term:

$$\sum_{i=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha i} \big[ \dots \big]$$

This approach offers several benefits:

1. **Exponential Decay**:
   - The term $e^{-\alpha i}$ ensures that higher-index neurons contribute less to the summation
   - Effectively "truncates" the influence of distant neurons without explicitly limiting the sum

2. **Biological Parallels**:
   - Mirrors how biological systems prioritize local interactions over distant ones
   - Reflects the Hebbian principle: "neurons that fire together wire together"

An alternative approach could use a softmax-like normalization:

$$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^\infty \big[ \dots \big]}{\sum_{i=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha i}}$$

This would ensure the summation remains bounded, even if individual terms grow large.

#### 3. Interaction Between Boltzmann Probabilities and Hebbian Learning

The GUCE framework integrates two complementary learning mechanisms:

1. **Boltzmann Term**:
   $$P(x_i, t) = \frac{e^{-\frac{E(x_i)}{kT}}}{\sum e^{-\frac{E(x_i{\prime})}{kT}}}$$
   - Introduces stochastic exploration by assigning probabilities based on energy levels
   - Higher temperatures ($T$) lead to more exploration, while lower temperatures focus on exploitation

2. **Hebbian Term**:
   $$W_{ij} \cos(\theta_{ij})$$
   - Strengthens connections between co-firing neurons
   - Introduces deterministic learning based on the similarity of neuron states

These mechanisms are combined in the term $\tilde{W}_{ij}$, which balances deterministic Hebbian learning with stochastic Boltzmann exploration:

$$\tilde{W}_{ij} = \beta W_{ij} \cos(\theta_{ij}) + (1 - \beta) P(x_i, t)$$

Where $\beta$ controls the balance between deterministic and stochastic learning.

## Verification Layers

To prove that each critical component of the GUCE framework works as intended, we break down the verification into layers. Once the components are proven, they can be unified into the complete system.

### 1. Proof of Cosine Similarity for Hebbian Connections

**Goal**: Verify that cosine similarity reflects neuron relationships properly and leads to meaningful weight updates.

**Key Question**: Does $W_{ij} \cos(\theta_{ij})$ correctly adjust weights based on neuron similarity?

**Approach**:
1. Generate synthetic neuron states $(h_i, h_j)$
2. Compute $\cos(\theta_{ij})$ for each pair
3. Update $W_{ij}$ and visualize the results to confirm that:
   - Similar neurons strengthen their connection $(\cos(\theta_{ij}) > 0)$
   - Dissimilar neurons weaken their connection $(\cos(\theta_{ij}) < 0)$

**Python Implementation**:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic neuron states
np.random.seed(42)
h_i = np.random.rand(8)
h_j = np.random.rand(8)

# Compute cosine similarity
def cosine_similarity(v1, v2):
    return np.dot(v1, v2) / (np.linalg.norm(v1) * np.linalg.norm(v2))

cos_sim = cosine_similarity(h_i, h_j)

# Initialize weights
W_ij = 0.5  # Initial weight

# Hebbian update rule
learning_rate = 0.01
W_ij += learning_rate * cos_sim

print(f"Cosine Similarity: {cos_sim:.4f}")
print(f"Updated Weight: {W_ij:.4f}")
```

**Expected Output**:
- Positive similarity increases $W_{ij}$
- Negative similarity decreases $W_{ij}$

### 2. Proof of Temporal Dynamics (LTC Evolution)

**Goal**: Verify that $\partial_t h_i(x_i, t)$ evolves neuron states as expected.

**Key Question**: Do neuron states $h_i$ converge to the input $u$ over time with decay governed by $\tau$?

**Approach**:
1. Simulate $h_i$ over time using $\partial_t h_i(x_i, t) = \frac{1}{\tau} (u - h_i)$
2. Confirm that:
   - $h_i \to u$ as $t \to \infty$
   - Larger $\tau$ slows convergence

**Python Implementation**:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# LTC neuron dynamics
def ltc_dynamics(h, u, tau, delta_t):
    return h + (delta_t / tau) * (u - h)

# Simulate over time
h = 0  # Initial state
u = 1  # Input
tau = 0.5
delta_t = 0.01
states = []

for t in range(100):  # 100 time steps
    h = ltc_dynamics(h, u, tau, delta_t)
    states.append(h)

# Visualize convergence
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(states)
plt.title("Neuron State Convergence")
plt.xlabel("Time Step")
plt.ylabel("Neuron State")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**Expected Output**:
- $h$ should asymptotically approach $u$
- Larger $\tau$ produces a slower curve

### 3. Proof of Boltzmann Distribution

**Goal**: Verify that $P(x_i, t)$ represents probabilities correctly and scales with temperature.

**Key Question**: Does the Boltzmann probability distribution behave as expected?

**Approach**:
1. Generate synthetic energy values
2. Compute probabilities $P(x_i, t) = \frac{\exp(-E / T)}{\sum \exp(-E / T)}$ at different temperatures $T$
3. Confirm that:
   - Higher $T$ flattens probabilities (more stochasticity)
   - Lower $T$ sharpens probabilities (more deterministic)

**Python Implementation**:

```python
import numpy as np

# Boltzmann probabilities
def boltzmann_probability(energies, temperature):
    exp_energies = np.exp(-np.array(energies) / temperature)
    return exp_energies / np.sum(exp_energies)

# Test with different temperatures
energies = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
temperatures = [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]

for T in temperatures:
    probs = boltzmann_probability(energies, T)
    print(f"Temperature: {T}, Probabilities: {probs}")
```

**Expected Output**:
- At $T = 0.1$, the lowest-energy state dominates
- At $T = 10.0$, probabilities are nearly uniform

### 4. Proof of Causality Integration

**Goal**: Verify that temporal integration $\int_0^T \partial_t h_i(x_i, t) dt$ correctly accumulates causal relationships.

**Key Question**: Does the system encode sequence order through time?

**Approach**:
1. Simulate neuron states across multiple time steps
2. Integrate over time to compute cumulative states
3. Confirm that the order of inputs influences the final state

**Python Implementation**:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate states from previous simulation
# (assuming 'states' is already defined from the LTC dynamics proof)

# Temporal integration
def temporal_causality(states, delta_t):
    return np.cumsum(states) * delta_t

# Simulate and integrate
delta_t = 0.01
cumulative_states = temporal_causality(states, delta_t)

# Visualize causality encoding
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(cumulative_states)
plt.title("Cumulative Causality Encoding")
plt.xlabel("Time Step")
plt.ylabel("Cumulative State")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**Expected Output**:
- The cumulative state reflects the order and timing of inputs
- Changes in sequence produce different cumulative patterns

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Replace the LTC neuron model with Wave Dynamics
- Implement an FFT-based representation of inputs
- Allow wave superposition to encode memory, learning, and generalization

### Step 2: Encode Learning as a Geometric Quantization Problem
- Instead of weight updates, modify the symplectic manifold structure over time
- Implement Poisson bracket updates instead of gradient-based updates

### Step 3: Introduce Stochastic Wave Interference
- Instead of hard-wired categorization, use probabilistic phase interference to allow flexible reasoning
- Implement a Boltzmann-Gibbs factor in activation propagation

## Bringing It All Together

Now that we've validated the key components, we can combine them into the grand unified equation:

$$S = \int_0^T \int \sum_{i=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha i} \Big[ \Psi(x_i, t) + \tilde{W}_{ij} \cos(\theta_{ij}) - \frac{1}{2} \tau (\partial_t h_i(x_i, t))^2 \Big] dx dt$$

**Proof Plan for the Full System**:
1. Simulate All Components:
   - Encode embeddings as waveforms $\Psi(x_i, t)$
   - Evolve neuron states $h_i(x_i, t)$ using LTC dynamics
   - Update $W_{ij}$ with cosine similarity
   - Apply Boltzmann probabilities to handle uncertainty
2. Visualize Emergent Behavior:
   - Confirm that neurons self-organize based on input patterns
   - Verify that temporal causality and relationships are preserved

## What This Proves

1. **Cosine Similarity**: Neurons strengthen connections when they're similar
2. **Temporal Dynamics**: LTC neurons encode memory over time
3. **Categorization**: Boltzmann distribution provides stochastic categorization
4. **Causality**: Integration over time preserves sequence relationships

## Expected Experimental Results

| Test | Expected Outcome |
|------|------------------|
| Wave interference encodes memory | Similar inputs should reinforce constructive interference (long-term retention) |
| Learning emerges as a geometric transformation | Cognitive shifts correspond to smooth deformations in the symplectic space |
| Temporal causality is retained | Wave propagation naturally encodes event relationships |
| Boltzmann interference aids generalization | Wave diffusion allows the system to predict patterns without explicit training |

## Integration with Quantum-Inspired Neural Networks

The GUCE framework can be integrated with quantum-inspired neural networks like LQNet and CTRQNet to enhance their capabilities. By incorporating wave dynamics and symplectic flow, these networks can better capture the complex relationships between inputs and outputs, leading to improved performance on tasks requiring temporal reasoning and causal inference.

### Example: Wave-Based Encoding in CTRQNet

```python
from ember_ml.nn.modules.rnn import CTRQNet
from ember_ml.nn.modules.wiring import NCPMap
from ember_ml.nn import tensor
from ember_ml import ops

# Create a neuron map
neuron_map = NCPMap(
    inter_neurons=32,
    command_neurons=16,
    motor_neurons=8,
    sensory_neurons=10,
    seed=42
)

# Create CTRQNet with wave dynamics
ctrqnet = CTRQNet(
    neuron_map=neuron_map,
    nu_0=1.0,
    beta=0.1,
    noise_scale=0.05,
    time_scale_factor=1.0,
    use_harmonic_embedding=True,  # Enable harmonic wave encoding
    return_sequences=True,
    return_state=False,
    batch_first=True
)

# Generate input data
inputs = tensor.random_normal((32, 100, 10))

# Forward pass
outputs = ctrqnet(inputs)
```

## Future Directions

The GUCE framework opens up new possibilities for neural network architectures that can better capture the complex dynamics of real-world systems. Future work will focus on:

1. Developing more sophisticated wave-based encoding mechanisms
2. Exploring the relationship between symplectic flow and causal inference
3. Investigating the role of wave interference in memory formation and retrieval
4. Applying the GUCE framework to problems in reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning
