# emberharmony Purification Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for the emberharmony purification initiative. The initiative aims to improve the codebase by:

1. Replacing direct NumPy usage with emberharmony's backend abstraction system
2. Improving BigQuery data handling for terabyte-scale datasets
3. Organizing notebook simulation tools in a dedicated directory
4. Centralizing documentation in a structured docs folder

This roadmap provides a timeline, resource requirements, and implementation strategy for each component of the purification initiative.

### 4. Documentation Reorganization

**Approach**: Centralize documentation in a structured docs folder.

**Key Steps**:
1. Create directory structure
2. Migrate existing documentation
3. Create navigation and index files
4. Update references and links
5. Set up documentation generation

**Success Criteria**:

**Detailed Plan**: See [Documentation Reorganization](documentation_reorganization.md)

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Backend incompatibilities | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing across backends |
| BigQuery API changes | Medium | Low | Version pinning, abstraction layer |
| Memory issues with large datasets | High | Medium | Incremental testing, circuit breakers |
| Breaking changes for users | High | Medium | Backward compatibility layer, clear migration guide |

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Underestimation of complexity | Medium | Medium | Buffer time in schedule, incremental approach |
| Resource constraints | High | Medium | Clear prioritization, phased implementation |
| Integration issues | Medium | Medium | Early integration testing, clear interfaces |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Strict scope management, separate future enhancements |

## Monitoring and Evaluation

### Performance Metrics

- **Backend Performance**: Execution time across different backends
- **Memory Usage**: Peak memory usage during processing
- **Processing Speed**: Time to process standard dataset
- **Code Quality**: Test coverage, static analysis metrics

### Success Criteria

- **Backend Abstraction**: 100% of NumPy operations replaced
- **BigQuery Streaming**: Successfully process 1TB+ datasets
- **Notebook Tools**: All tools organized and accessible as package
- **Documentation**: All documentation centralized and consistent

## Next Steps

1. **Approval**: Review and approve purification plan
2. **Resource Allocation**: Assign personnel and resources
3. **Kickoff**: Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. **Regular Reviews**: Weekly progress reviews
5. **Incremental Releases**: Release improvements incrementally

## Conclusion

The emberharmony purification initiative represents a significant investment in the quality, performance, and maintainability of the codebase. By implementing these improvements, we will create a more robust, efficient, and user-friendly library that can handle truly large-scale data processing tasks.

The phased approach allows for incremental improvements while managing risks and ensuring backward compatibility. The end result will be a purified emberharmony codebase that leverages modern best practices and provides optimal performance across different hardware platforms.
