# emberharmony Backend Purification (COMPLETED)

This document describes the completed purification of the `TerabyteFeatureExtractor` and `TerabyteTemporalStrideProcessor` classes to use emberharmony's backend abstraction system instead of direct NumPy calls. The purified implementation is now the official implementation in the emberharmony codebase.

## Overview

The purification process replaces direct NumPy usage with emberharmony's backend abstraction system, which automatically selects the optimal computational backend (MLX, PyTorch, or NumPy) based on availability. This allows the code to run efficiently on different hardware without modification.

Key benefits of this purification:

1. **Automatic GPU acceleration** when available
2. **Consistent API** across different backends
3. **Better performance on Apple Silicon** via MLX
4. **Simplified code maintenance**

## Implementation Details

The purification involved the following changes:

1. **Import Changes**:
   - Removed direct NumPy import
   - Added imports from emberharmony.utils and emberharmony.ops

2. **Constructor Changes**:
   - Added preferred_backend parameter
   - Added backend initialization
   - Replaced np.random.seed with backend_utils.initialize_random_seed

3. **Function Replacements**:
   - Random number generation: np.random.rand → backend_utils.random_uniform
   - Trigonometric functions: np.sin, np.cos → backend_utils.sin_cos_transform
   - Array operations: np.vstack → backend_utils.vstack_safe
   - Tensor conversion: Added utilities for safely converting between NumPy arrays and backend tensors

## Files

- `emberharmony/features/terabyte_feature_extractor.py`: The purified implementation (now the official implementation)
- `tests/test_terabyte_feature_extractor_purified_v2.py`: Unit tests to verify the purified implementation
- `run_purification_tests_v2.py`: Script to run tests, demonstrate usage, and benchmark performance

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run the tests and benchmarks:

```bash
python run_purification_tests_v2.py
```

Command-line options:

- `--skip-tests`: Skip running unit tests
- `--skip-demo`: Skip demonstration of usage
- `--skip-benchmark`: Skip performance benchmarks
- `--benchmark-size SIZE`: Size of dataset for benchmarking (default: 10000)
- `--benchmark-iterations N`: Number of iterations for benchmarking (default: 5)

### Using the Purified Implementation

To use the purified implementation in your code:

```python
from emberharmony.features.terabyte_feature_extractor import (
    TerabyteFeatureExtractor,
    TerabyteTemporalStrideProcessor
)

# Create feature extractor with preferred backend
extractor = TerabyteFeatureExtractor(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    location="US",
    chunk_size=100000,
    max_memory_gb=16.0,
    preferred_backend="mlx"  # Try to use MLX if available
)

# Create temporal stride processor with the same backend
processor = TerabyteTemporalStrideProcessor(
    window_size=5,
    stride_perspectives=[1, 3, 5],
    pca_components=32,
    batch_size=10000,
    use_incremental_pca=True,
    preferred_backend="mlx"  # Use the same backend as the extractor
)
```

### Selecting a Backend

The `preferred_backend` parameter allows you to specify which backend to use:

- `"mlx"`: Use Apple's MLX framework (optimized for Apple Silicon)
- `"torch"`: Use PyTorch
- `"numpy"`: Use NumPy
- `None`: Let emberharmony choose the best available backend

## Performance

The purified implementation can provide significant performance improvements, especially when using GPU-accelerated backends like MLX or PyTorch. The benchmarks in `run_purification_tests_v2.py` demonstrate these performance gains.

## Implementation Status

The purification has been completed and the purified implementation is now the official implementation in the emberharmony codebase. The following changes have been made:

1. **Code Replacement**: The original implementation has been replaced with the purified implementation
2. **Import Updates**: All imports have been updated to use the new implementation
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests have been added to verify the purified implementation
4. **Documentation**: Documentation has been updated to reflect the backend-agnostic approach

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune performance for specific backends
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Continue testing the purified implementation with real-world data and across different hardware platforms
3. **Feature Expansion**: Expand the backend-agnostic approach to other parts of the codebase
4. **Documentation Enhancement**: Enhance API documentation with examples of using different backends

## Conclusion

This purification is a critical step in making emberharmony more efficient and flexible. By leveraging the backend abstraction system, we can achieve better performance across different hardware platforms while maintaining a consistent API.
