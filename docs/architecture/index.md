# emberharmony Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This section contains architectural documentation for the emberharmony library, focusing on design principles, system architecture, and implementation plans for major improvements.

## Purification Initiative

The emberharmony purification initiative aims to improve the codebase by:

1. Replacing direct NumPy usage with emberharmony's backend abstraction system
2. Improving BigQuery data handling for terabyte-scale datasets
3. Organizing notebook simulation tools in a dedicated directory
4. Centralizing documentation in a structured docs folder

## Core Architecture

### Backend Abstraction System

emberharmony uses a backend abstraction system that automatically selects the optimal computational backend (MLX, PyTorch, or NumPy) based on availability. This allows code to run efficiently on different hardware without modification.

Key components:
- Backend detection and selection
- Unified API for tensor operations
- Automatic device placement
- Memory optimization

### Data Processing Architecture

The data processing architecture is designed to handle terabyte-scale datasets efficiently, with a focus on:

- Streaming processing for large datasets
- Memory-efficient operations
- Chunked processing with adaptive sizing
- Distributed processing capabilities

### Feature Extraction Pipeline

The feature extraction pipeline provides a comprehensive workflow for extracting features from large datasets:

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering and transformation
3. Scaling and normalization
4. Train/validation/test splitting
5. Model integration

## Implementation Principles

The emberharmony codebase follows these key implementation principles:

1. **Backend Agnosticism**: Code should work with any supported backend
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Operations should minimize memory usage
3. **Scalability**: Components should scale to terabyte-sized datasets
4. **Modularity**: Systems should be modular and composable
5. **Testability**: Code should be thoroughly tested across backends

## Future Directions

Planned architectural improvements include:

1. **Distributed Processing**: Enhanced support for distributed computation
2. **Streaming Feature Engineering**: Real-time feature engineering capabilities
3. **Model Integration**: Tighter integration with machine learning models
4. **Visualization Tools**: Enhanced visualization for large-scale data

## Contributing to Architecture

When contributing architectural changes to emberharmony:

1. Start with a clear architectural design document
2. Discuss major changes with the team before implementation
3. Ensure backward compatibility where possible
4. Provide comprehensive tests for new components
5. Update documentation to reflect architectural changes

## Conclusion

The emberharmony architecture is designed to provide efficient, scalable, and flexible tools for processing terabyte-scale datasets. By following the principles and plans outlined in this documentation, we can ensure that emberharmony continues to evolve as a robust and powerful library for data processing and feature extraction.
