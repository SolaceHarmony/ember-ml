# Development Plans

This directory contains development plans and technical documentation for Ember ML.

## Files

- **README_BACKEND_FIX.md**: Documentation of the backend switching fix implementation
- **sigmoid_consolidation_plan.md**: Plan for consolidating sigmoid function implementations across the codebase

## Purpose

These documents outline development plans, architectural decisions, and implementation details for Ember ML. They serve as a reference for developers working on the project and provide context for understanding the codebase.

## Adding New Plans

When adding new development plans to this directory, please follow these guidelines:

1. Use clear, descriptive names for files
2. Include a detailed explanation of the problem being addressed
3. Outline the proposed solution with implementation details
4. Document any trade-offs or alternatives considered
5. Add the new plan to this README.md file

# Ember ML Documentation

This directory contains the consolidated and up-to-date documentation for the Ember ML project. The documentation is organized into categories, each in its own subdirectory.

## Directory Structure

- **tensor_implementation/**: Documentation related to tensor operations implementation
- **implementation_plans/**: Documentation related to implementation plans
- **compatibility_plans/**: Documentation related to compatibility plans
- **architecture/**: Documentation related to architecture
- **project/**: Documentation related to the project as a whole

## Using This Documentation

To navigate the documentation, start with the [index.md](index.md) file, which provides an overview of all the documentation and links to specific documents.

Each document is written in Markdown format and can be viewed directly on GitHub or using any Markdown viewer.

## Maintaining This Documentation

### Adding New Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Determine the appropriate category for the document
2. Create the document in the corresponding subdirectory
3. Use a clear and descriptive filename
4. Update the [index.md](index.md) file to include a link to the new document

### Updating Existing Documentation

When updating existing documentation:

1. Make changes directly to the document in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Do not create new versions of documents; instead, update the existing document
3. If the changes are substantial, consider adding a "Last Updated" date at the top of the document

### Removing Obsolete Documentation

When documentation becomes obsolete:

1. Do not delete the document immediately
2. Instead, mark it as deprecated at the top of the document
3. Add a link to the replacement document, if applicable
4. After a reasonable period, the document can be removed

## Document Format

All documents should follow this format:

1. **Title**: A clear and descriptive title at the top of the document
2. **Introduction**: A brief introduction explaining the purpose of the document
3. **Main Content**: The main content of the document, organized into sections
4. **Conclusion**: A brief conclusion summarizing the key points
5. **Related Documents**: Links to related documents, if applicable

## Markdown Guidelines

- Use `#` for main headings, `##` for subheadings, etc.
- Use backticks for inline code and triple backticks for code blocks
- Use bullet points (`-` or `*`) for lists
- Use numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, etc.) for sequential steps
- Use links to reference other documents or external resources
- Use tables for tabular data
- Use images sparingly and only when necessary

## Keeping Documentation Current

The documentation should be kept current with the codebase. When making significant changes to the code:

1. Update the corresponding documentation
2. If the changes affect multiple documents, update all of them
3. If the changes make existing documentation obsolete, follow the guidelines for removing obsolete documentation

## Questions and Feedback

If you have questions about the documentation or would like to provide feedback, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
