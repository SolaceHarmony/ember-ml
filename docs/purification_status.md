# Backend Purification Status

This document tracks the status of purifying direct NumPy and pandas usage in the emberharmony codebase, replacing them with the backend abstraction system.

## Overview

The emberharmony backend system automatically selects the optimal computational backend (MLX, PyTorch, or NumPy) based on availability. This allows code to run efficiently on different hardware without modification.

## Acceptable Direct NumPy Usage

In some cases, direct NumPy usage is acceptable:

1. **Backend-specific code**: When the code is specifically checking for the NumPy backend before using NumPy directly.
   ```python
   if backend_utils.get_current_backend() == 'numpy':
       import numpy as np
       return np.abs(components).sum(axis=0)
   else:
       return ops.sum(ops.abs(components), axis=0)
   ```

2. **Data conversion**: When converting between NumPy arrays and backend tensors.
   ```python
   # Convert to numpy for pandas
   df[f'{col}_sin_hour'] = backend_utils.tensor_to_numpy_safe(hours_sin)
   ```

3. **External library integration**: When interfacing with libraries that specifically require NumPy arrays.
   ```python
   # For sklearn which requires NumPy
   from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
   self.pca_models[stride] = PCA(n_components=n_components)
   self.pca_models[stride].fit(flat_windows)
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize core components**: Focus on purifying core components first, especially those that are performance-critical.
2. **Create purification templates**: Develop templates for common patterns to make purification more consistent.
3. **Add tests**: Ensure each purified component has tests that verify it works with different backends.
4. **Update documentation**: Update API documentation to reflect the backend-agnostic approach.
5. **Performance benchmarks**: Create benchmarks to measure performance improvements across different backends.

## Conclusion

The purification of the TerabyteFeatureExtractor and TerabyteTemporalStrideProcessor classes is a significant first step in the larger emberharmony purification plan. This sets the foundation for a more robust and efficient codebase that can automatically leverage different computational backends based on availability.
