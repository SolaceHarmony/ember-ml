## 4. Feature Extraction Strategies

### 4.1 Basic Strategy

The basic strategy will extract fundamental image features without requiring deep learning models:

- **Dimensional Features**:
  - Image dimensions (height, width, channels)
  - Aspect ratio
  - Resolution metrics

- **Color Features**:
  - Color histograms (RGB, HSV)
  - Color moments (mean, standard deviation, skewness per channel)
  - Dominant colors
  - Color coherence

- **Texture Features**:
  - Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features
  - Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
  - Haralick texture features

- **Edge and Shape Features**:
  - Edge histograms
  - Canny edge detection features
  - Hough transform features
  - Shape descriptors

- **Statistical Features**:
  - Mean, standard deviation, min, max per channel
  - Entropy
  - Energy
  - Contrast

### 4.2 CNN-Based Strategy

The CNN-based strategy will leverage pre-trained convolutional neural networks to extract high-level features:

- **Pre-trained Models**:
  - Support for common architectures (ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet)
  - Backend-specific implementations (PyTorch, MLX)
  - Feature extraction from intermediate layers

- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - PCA for reducing feature dimensionality
  - Feature selection based on importance

- **Transfer Learning**:
  - Fine-tuning options for domain-specific feature extraction
  - Layer selection for optimal feature representation

### 4.3 Custom Strategy

The custom strategy will provide a flexible interface for user-defined feature extraction:

- **Callback Interface**:
  - User-provided functions for custom feature extraction
  - Support for custom preprocessing steps

- **Pipeline Integration**:
  - Ability to combine with other strategies
  - Consistent output format for downstream processing

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Image Loading and Preprocessing

```python
def _load_images(self, image_data, target_size=None):
    """
    Load images from various input formats.
    
    Args:
        image_data: Can be file paths, arrays, or tensors
        target_size: Optional target size for resizing
        
    Returns:
        Loaded and preprocessed images in the appropriate format
    """
    # Implementation will handle:
    # - File path loading with PIL or OpenCV
    # - Array/tensor validation and conversion
    # - Resizing and normalization
    # - Backend-specific tensor conversion
```

### 5.2 Basic Feature Extraction

```python
def _extract_basic_features(self, images):
    """
    Extract basic features from images.
    
    Args:
        images: Preprocessed image data
        
    Returns:
        DataFrame or tensor with extracted features
    """
    # Implementation will extract:
    # - Dimensional features
    # - Color features
    # - Texture features
    # - Edge and shape features
    # - Statistical features
```

### 5.3 CNN-Based Feature Extraction

```python
def _extract_cnn_features(self, images, model_name='resnet18', layers=None):
    """
    Extract features using a pre-trained CNN model.
    
    Args:
        images: Preprocessed image data
        model_name: Name of the pre-trained model to use
        layers: Specific layers to extract features from
        
    Returns:
        DataFrame or tensor with extracted features
    """
    # Implementation will:
    # - Load the appropriate model based on the backend
    # - Extract features from specified layers
    # - Apply dimensionality reduction if needed
    # - Return features in a consistent format
```

### 5.4 Backend Agnosticism

The implementation will use the ops abstraction layer for all mathematical operations to ensure compatibility with different backends:

```python
# Example of backend-agnostic implementation
def _compute_color_histogram(self, image, bins=10):
    """Compute color histogram in a backend-agnostic way."""
    # Convert image to appropriate tensor type
    image_tensor = ops.convert_to_tensor(image)
    
    # Compute histogram using ops functions
    histograms = []
    for channel in range(image_tensor.shape[-1]):
        channel_data = ops.slice(image_tensor, [0, 0, channel], 
                                [image_tensor.shape[0], image_tensor.shape[1], 1])
        channel_data = ops.reshape(channel_data, [-1])
        hist = ops.histogram(channel_data, bins=bins)
        histograms.append(hist)
    
    return ops.concatenate(histograms, axis=0)
```

## 6. Integration with Existing System

### 6.1 Integration Points

The `ImageFeatureExtractor` will integrate with the existing system at these points:

1. **Feature Extraction Pipeline**:
   - Can be used alongside other extractors
   - Follows the same fit/transform pattern

2. **Backend System**:
   - Uses the ops abstraction layer
   - Supports all backends (NumPy, PyTorch, MLX)

3. **Data Processing Flow**:
   - Accepts various input formats
   - Produces standardized output for downstream tasks

### 6.2 Example Usage

```python
# Example usage in a pipeline
from emberharmony.features.image_feature_extraction import ImageFeatureExtractor

# Initialize extractor
image_extractor = ImageFeatureExtractor(
    strategy='basic',
    include_color=True,
    include_texture=True,
    include_edges=True
)

# Extract features from image paths
image_paths = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg']
features = image_extractor.fit_transform(image_paths)

# Use features for downstream tasks
model.fit(features, labels)
```
