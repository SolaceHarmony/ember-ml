# Feature Extraction and Neural Network Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the feature extraction process and how it integrates with the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and liquid neural network components in our data processing pipeline. It provides a high-level overview of the key components, their interactions, and the data flow through the system.

## Feature Extraction Process

### 1. BigQuery Data Extraction

The first step in our pipeline is extracting data from terabyte-sized tables in BigQuery using the BigFrames API. This process includes:

- **Connection Setup**: Establishing a connection to BigQuery with appropriate credentials and settings optimized for large-scale data processing.
- **Query Optimization**: Creating optimized queries with appropriate filtering and projection to minimize data transfer.
- **Chunked Processing**: Processing data in manageable chunks to avoid memory limitations.

```python
# Example of optimized BigQuery connection
import bigframes.pandas as bf
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Set up credentials
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/credentials.json',
    scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform']
)

# Configure BigFrames
bf.options.bigquery.project = 'your-project-id'
bf.options.bigquery.location = 'US'
bf.options.bigquery.credentials = credentials

# Read data in chunks
chunk_size = 100000
for i in range(0, total_rows, chunk_size):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM `your-table` LIMIT {chunk_size} OFFSET {i}"
    chunk_df = bf.read_gbq(query)
    # Process chunk
```

### 2. Type Detection and Feature Engineering

Once data is extracted, we detect column types and apply appropriate transformations:

- **Type Detection**: Automatically categorizing columns as numeric, categorical, datetime, or boolean.
- **Numeric Features**: Scaling and normalization.
- **Categorical Features**: One-hot encoding or embedding.
- **Datetime Features**: Creating cyclical features (hour, day, month) using sine and cosine transformations.
- **Text Features**: Basic text features or vectorization.

```python
# Example of feature engineering
from emberharmony.features.column_feature_extraction import ColumnFeatureExtractor

# Create feature extractor
extractor = ColumnFeatureExtractor(
    numeric_strategy='standard',
    categorical_strategy='onehot',
    datetime_strategy='cyclical',
    text_strategy='basic'
)

# Fit and transform
features_df = extractor.fit_transform(data_df)
```

### 3. Temporal Stride Processing

For time series data, we apply temporal stride processing to capture patterns at different time scales:

- **Window Creation**: Creating sliding windows with different stride lengths.
- **Multi-Perspective Analysis**: Processing data with different stride perspectives (e.g., 1, 3, 5).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applying PCA to reduce the dimensionality of windowed data.

```python
# Example of temporal stride processing
from emberharmony.features.bigquery_feature_extraction import BigQueryTemporalStrideProcessor

# Create processor
processor = BigQueryTemporalStrideProcessor(
    window_size=5,
    stride_perspectives=[1, 3, 5],
    pca_components=32
)

# Process data
stride_perspectives = processor.process_batch(feature_data)
```

## RBM Feature Learning

After feature extraction, we use Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to learn latent representations:

### 1. RBM Architecture

- **Visible Layer**: Corresponds to the extracted features.
- **Hidden Layer**: Learns latent representations of the data.
- **Energy-Based Model**: Uses energy function to model joint distribution.

```python
# Example of RBM initialization
from emberharmony.models.rbm import RestrictedBoltzmannMachine

# Create RBM
rbm = RestrictedBoltzmannMachine(
    n_visible=feature_dim,
    n_hidden=hidden_dim,
    learning_rate=0.01,
    momentum=0.5,
    batch_size=100
)
```

### 2. Training Process

- **Contrastive Divergence**: Efficient training algorithm for RBMs.
- **Mini-Batch Processing**: Training in mini-batches for memory efficiency.
- **Gibbs Sampling**: Alternating between visible and hidden states.

```python
# Example of RBM training
# Train in chunks for large datasets
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in data_generator:
        rbm.contrastive_divergence(batch, k=1)
```

### 3. Feature Extraction

- **Hidden Layer Activation**: Using the hidden layer activations as features.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the dimensionality of the original features.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Capturing complex patterns in the data.

```python
# Example of feature extraction from RBM
rbm_features = rbm.transform(input_data)
```

## Liquid Neural Network Integration

The final component is the CfC-based liquid neural network with LSTM gating:

### 1. Network Architecture

- **CfC Cells**: Closed-form Continuous-time cells for temporal processing.
- **AutoNCP Wiring**: Neural Circuit Policy wiring for connectivity.
- **LSTM Gating**: Long Short-Term Memory cells for gating mechanisms.

```python
# Example of liquid neural network creation
from emberharmony.nn.wirings import AutoNCP
from emberharmony.core.stride_aware_cfc import StrideAwareCfC, StrideAwareWiredCfCCell

# Create wiring
wiring = AutoNCP(units=64, output_size=32, sparsity_level=0.5)

# Create CfC cell
cell = StrideAwareWiredCfCCell(wiring=wiring, stride_length=1, time_scale_factor=1.0)

# Create CfC layer
cfc_layer = StrideAwareCfC(cell=cell, return_sequences=False, mixed_memory=True)
```

### 2. Multi-Stride Processing

- **Stride-Aware Cells**: Processing data with different stride lengths.
- **Time Scale Factors**: Adjusting time scales for different perspectives.
- **Mixed Memory**: Combining information from different time scales.

```python
# Example of multi-stride processing
inputs = []
outputs = []

for stride in stride_perspectives:
    input_layer = Input(shape=(None, feature_dim))
    inputs.append(input_layer)
    
    cell = StrideAwareWiredCfCCell(wiring=wiring, stride_length=stride)
    cfc_layer = StrideAwareCfC(cell=cell, return_sequences=False)
    
    output = cfc_layer(input_layer)
    outputs.append(output)

merged = Concatenate()(outputs)
```

### 3. Motor Neuron Output

- **Output Layer**: Final layer producing the motor neuron output.
- **Threshold Mechanism**: Determining when to trigger deeper exploration.
- **Adaptive Threshold**: Adjusting threshold based on recent history.

```python
# Example of motor neuron implementation
class MotorNeuron(Layer):
    def __init__(self, threshold=0.5, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.threshold = threshold
    
    def call(self, inputs):
        output = self.activation(inputs)
        trigger = tf.cast(output > self.threshold, tf.float32)
        return output, trigger
```

## End-to-End Data Flow

The complete data flow through the system is as follows:

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract data from BigQuery in chunks.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Apply type-specific transformations to create features.
3. **Temporal Processing**: Process features with different stride perspectives.
4. **RBM Learning**: Train RBM on processed features to learn latent representations.
5. **Liquid Neural Network**: Process RBM features through CfC network with LSTM gating.
6. **Motor Neuron**: Generate output value and trigger signal for deeper exploration.

## Conclusion

This feature extraction and neural network integration approach provides a scalable and efficient way to process terabyte-sized tables from BigQuery, extract meaningful features, learn latent representations with RBMs, and process them through a CfC-based liquid neural network with LSTM gating to produce motor neuron outputs that can trigger deeper exploration of the data.

The modular design allows for flexibility and extensibility, while the optimized implementation ensures performance and scalability for large-scale data processing.
