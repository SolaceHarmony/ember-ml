# Notebook Issue Summary

## The Issue

The issue in the original notebook was that we were trying to pass a `process_chunk` function to the `prepare_data` method of the `TerabyteFeatureExtractor` class, but this method doesn't accept a `processing_fn` parameter directly. This resulted in the error:

```
TypeError: TerabyteFeatureExtractor.prepare_data() got an unexpected keyword argument 'processing_fn'
```

Looking at the `terabyte_feature_extractor_bigframes.py` file, we can see that the `prepare_data` method defines its own `process_chunk` function internally and passes that to `process_bigquery_in_chunks`. However, in the notebook, we were trying to pass a `process_chunk` function directly to `prepare_data`, which doesn't accept that parameter.

## The Fix

The fix is simple: remove the `processing_fn` parameter from the call to `prepare_data`. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Extract features - FIXED: removed processing_fn parameter
result = feature_extractor.prepare_data(
    table_id=TABLE_ID,
    target_column=TARGET_COLUMN,
    limit=LIMIT
    # REMOVED: processing_fn=process_chunk
)
```

## The Simulation

To test our fix, we created a simulation of the notebook using Python scripts. Each script represents a cell in the notebook, and they can be run in sequence to simulate the notebook execution. This approach allows us to:

1. Debug the issue without needing Jupyter
2. Test our fix in a controlled environment
3. Understand what's happening at each step

The simulation uses pickle files to pass data between cells, simulating how Jupyter maintains state between cells.

## Conclusion

The issue was a simple one: we were passing a parameter to a function that doesn't accept it. By removing the `processing_fn` parameter from the call to `prepare_data`, we were able to fix the issue and get the notebook working correctly.

This highlights the importance of understanding the API of the functions you're using, especially when working with complex data processing pipelines. It also shows the value of creating simple simulations to debug issues in a controlled environment.
