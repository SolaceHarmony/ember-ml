# Completed Projects

This directory contains documentation for completed refactoring and migration projects.

## Contents

- [RNN Module Migration](rnn_module_migration.md) - Migration of RNN module parameters from cell files into their respective layer files, removing the cell-based architecture.
- [Neural Network Architecture Refactoring Plan](nn_architecture_refactor_plan.md) - Comprehensive plan for refactoring the `ember_ml.nn` package to establish a clear, consistent, and maintainable architecture for neural network components.
- [RNN Deferred Build Refactor](rnn_deferred_build_refactor.md) - Detailed implementation plan for the deferred build mechanism in RNN modules.
- [Neural Network Modules Architecture](neural_network_modules.md) - Comprehensive overview of the neural network modules in Ember ML, with a focus on the Neural Circuit Policies (NCPs) and their implementation.

## Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to maintain a record of completed architectural changes and refactoring efforts. This helps:

1. Track the evolution of the codebase
2. Provide context for future developers
3. Document design decisions and their rationale
4. Serve as a reference for similar future projects

Each document in this directory describes a completed project, including:

- The original problem or limitation
- The approach taken to address it
- The specific changes made
- The benefits realized from the changes
- Any lessons learned during implementation
