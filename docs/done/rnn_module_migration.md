# RNN Module Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the completed migration of RNN module parameters from cell files into their respective layer files. The goal was to simplify the codebase by removing redundant cell implementations while preserving all functionality.

## Migration Pattern

The migration followed a consistent pattern:

1. **Parameter Migration**: Move all cell parameters to the layer class
2. **Logic Implementation**: Implement cell logic directly in the layer's forward method
3. **Initialization Handling**: Update parameter initialization in the layer's build method
4. **File Removal**: Remove the cell file and update imports in __init__.py

## Completed Migrations

### WiredCfCCell

- Migrated functionality into `cfc.py`
- Removed `wired_cfc_cell.py`

## Base Class Removal

The following base classes were also removed:

1. `module_cell.py` - Base class for all cell types
2. `module_wired_cell.py` - Base class for wired cell types

## Benefits

This migration provides several benefits:

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Reduces the number of classes and files
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Centralizes logic in a single file
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminates the need to manage separate cell objects
4. **Better Performance**: Potentially reduces overhead by eliminating cell object creation

## Implementation Notes

- All migrated files pass emberlint checks with no errors
- The migration preserves all functionality while simplifying the codebase
- Special attention was paid to fixing Python operators by using ops functions
- Parameter initialization was carefully handled to maintain consistency
- Cross-backend compatibility was ensured for PyTorch, MLX, and NumPy
- Circular dependencies were resolved by restructuring imports

## Additional Improvements

1. **Backend Compatibility**:
   - Made tensor conversion backend-agnostic by handling device attribute differences
   - Implemented forget gate bias initialization that works across all backends
   - Used backend-agnostic range operations

2. **Import Structure**:
   - Removed circular dependencies
   - Simplified module imports
   - Temporarily commented out problematic imports in `__init__.py` files

3. **Code Structure**:
   - Simplified class hierarchy
   - Reduced file count
   - Improved readability
