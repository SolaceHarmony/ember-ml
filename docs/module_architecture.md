# Distinction Between emberharmony.nn and emberharmony.models

Based on my examination of the codebase, I can provide a clear distinction between the `emberharmony.nn` and `emberharmony.models` modules, as well as how they relate to domain-specific models like those in `emberharmony.wave.models`.

## Module Roles and Responsibilities

### emberharmony.nn

The `nn` module serves as the foundation for neural network components:

- **Purpose**: Provides building blocks and components for constructing neural networks
- **Level of Abstraction**: Low-level neural architecture components
- **Scope**: Generic neural network primitives that can be used across different domains
- **Examples**:
  - `Module` class (base class for all neural network modules)
  - `Parameter` class (trainable parameters)
  - Specialized neurons
  - Modulation mechanisms
  - CFC layers

The `nn` module is analogous to PyTorch's `torch.nn` - it provides the fundamental building blocks that can be composed to create complete models.

### emberharmony.models

The `models` module contains complete, ready-to-use machine learning models:

- **Purpose**: Provides fully implemented machine learning algorithms
- **Level of Abstraction**: High-level, ready-to-use models
- **Scope**: General-purpose machine learning models not specific to a particular domain
- **Examples**:
  - `RestrictedBoltzmannMachine` (RBM implementation)
  - `RBM` (PyTorch-based implementation)

The `models` module is analogous to PyTorch's model collections like `torchvision.models` - it provides complete implementations that users can directly apply to their tasks.

### emberharmony.wave.models

The `wave.models` module contains models specifically designed for wave-based neural processing:

- **Purpose**: Provides models tailored for wave-based processing
- **Level of Abstraction**: High-level, domain-specific models
- **Scope**: Models specifically designed for wave-based neural processing
- **Examples**:
  - `WaveRNN` (RNN for wave-based processing)
  - `WaveTransformer` (Transformer for wave-based processing)
  - `WaveAutoencoder` (Autoencoder for wave-based processing)

This module demonstrates how domain-specific models are organized within their respective domain modules rather than in the general `models` module.

## Architectural Relationships

The relationship between these modules follows a clear hierarchy:

1. **emberharmony.nn**: Provides the foundational components
2. **emberharmony.models**: Builds general-purpose models using components from `nn`
3. **Domain-specific models** (like `wave.models`): Build domain-specific models using components from both `nn` and their respective domain modules

This organization allows for:

- **Reusability**: Components in `nn` can be reused across different models
- **Separation of Concerns**: Domain-specific logic stays within domain modules
- **Extensibility**: New domains can add their own model implementations

## Recommended Organization

Based on this analysis, I recommend maintaining this clear separation:

1. **emberharmony.nn**: Keep as the foundation for neural network components
2. **emberharmony.math**: Centralize all mathematical functions here
3. **emberharmony.ops**: Focus on ML library tensor and scalar operations
4. **emberharmony.models**: Maintain as the home for general-purpose models
5. **Domain-specific models**: Keep within their respective domain modules

This organization provides a clean, intuitive structure that aligns with industry standards like PyTorch while maintaining the unique aspects of the EmberHarmony library.
