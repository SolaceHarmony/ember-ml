"""Legacy wave processing test suite.

This module contains historical tests for wave processing components,
maintained for compatibility verification:

Key Test Areas:
    - Historical wave transformation implementations
    - Legacy memory system behavior
    - Deprecated interface compatibility
    - Version migration validation
    - Backwards compatibility checks

These tests help ensure smooth transitions between versions while
maintaining backend-agnostic behavior.
