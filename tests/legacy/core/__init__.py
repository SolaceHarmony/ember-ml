"""Legacy core neural network implementation tests.

This package validates historical neural network implementations:

Test Categories:
    - Original architecture validations
    - Legacy parameter handling
    - Historical gradient computations
    - Deprecated feature support
    - Version transition tests

These tests ensure that core functionality remains stable across
version updates while maintaining backend independence.
