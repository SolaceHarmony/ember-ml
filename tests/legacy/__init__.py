"""Legacy Test Framework for Ember ML.

Contains historical test implementations and compatibility checks
to ensure smooth version transitions and API stability.

Components:
    Legacy Tests:
        - Historical implementation validation
        - API compatibility verification
        - Deprecated feature testing
        
    Migration Tests:
        - Version upgrade validation
        - Breaking change detection
        - Backward compatibility checks
        
    Compatibility Layer:
        - Legacy API support
        - Version translation helpers
        - Deprecation warnings

These tests help maintain stability during framework evolution
while preserving backend independence.
