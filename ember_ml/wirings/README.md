# ember_ml Wirings

This module provides general network connectivity utilities and wiring patterns that are not specific to neural networks.

## Relationship with ember_ml.nn.wirings

It's important to understand the distinction between this module (`ember_ml.wirings`) and the neural network specific wirings (`ember_ml.nn.wirings`):

- **ember_ml.wirings**: Contains general connectivity utilities and patterns that can be used in various contexts, not just neural networks. This includes graph-based connectivity, general network topologies, and utility functions for working with connectivity patterns.

- **ember_ml.nn.wirings**: Contains neural network specific wiring implementations, such as Neural Circuit Policy (NCP) wirings, fully connected wirings, and random wirings. These are specifically designed for use with neural network components in the `ember_ml.nn` module.

## Usage

For neural network specific wirings, such as those used with Neural Circuit Policies, you should use the implementations in `ember_ml.nn.wirings`:

```python
from ember_ml.nn.wirings import NCPWiring, FullyConnectedWiring, RandomWiring

# Create a Neural Circuit Policy wiring
wiring = NCPWiring(
    inter_neurons=10,
    motor_neurons=5,
    sensory_neurons=0,
    sparsity_level=0.5,
    seed=42
)
```

For general connectivity patterns and utilities, use this module:

```python
from ember_ml.wirings import create_connectivity_graph, analyze_network_topology

# Create a connectivity graph
graph = create_connectivity_graph(nodes, edges)

# Analyze network topology
metrics = analyze_network_topology(graph)
```

## Implementation

This module is currently a placeholder for future implementations of general connectivity utilities. As the library evolves, more functionality will be added to this module to support various types of network connectivity patterns beyond neural networks.
