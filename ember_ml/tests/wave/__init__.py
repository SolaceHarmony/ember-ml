"""Wave Processing Test Suite.

Validates wave-based neural processing components with emphasis
on numerical accuracy and backend independence.

Test Areas:
    Wave Operations:
        - Transformation accuracy
        - Frequency analysis
        - Phase relationships
        
    Memory Systems:
        - State preservation
        - Interference patterns
        - Temporal stability
        
    Multi-Sphere Tests:
        - Interaction dynamics
        - Boundary behavior
        - Energy conservation

All tests maintain backend purity through the ops abstraction layer.
