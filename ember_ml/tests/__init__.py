"""Ember ML Core Test Framework.

Provides the foundational testing infrastructure and utilities for
ensuring correctness across the Ember ML library.

Components:
    Test Utilities:
        - Backend switching helpers
        - Tensor comparison tools
        - Numerical precision checks
        
    Test Categories:
        - Unit tests for core operations
        - Integration tests for modules
        - Performance benchmarks
        - Cross-backend validation
        
    Test Infrastructure:
        - Fixture management
        - Test data generation
        - Output validation tools

All test components maintain strict backend independence and
support validation across all supported computational backends.
