# Binary Wave Neural Networks in MLX

This directory contains a sandbox implementation of binary wave neural networks using MLX. The implementation is based on the concepts described in the architecture documents in the `docs/architecture/` directory.

## Overview

Binary wave neural networks are a novel approach to neural network computation that uses binary operations (AND, OR, XOR) and wave-based propagation to process information. This approach has several advantages:

1. **Efficiency**: Binary operations are computationally efficient and can be implemented using bitwise operations.
2. **Memory**: Binary representations require less memory than floating-point representations.
3. **Hardware Compatibility**: Binary operations map well to hardware implementations.
4. **Wave Dynamics**: Wave-based propagation allows for complex temporal dynamics with simple operations.

## Files

- `mlx_binary_wave.py`: Pure MLX implementation of binary wave operations.
- `binary_wave_nn.py`: Simple binary wave neural network implementation using MLX.
- `mlx_mega_number.py`: MLX implementation of MegaNumber from BizarroMath.
- `mlx_mega_binary.py`: MLX implementation of MegaBinary from BizarroMath.
- `binary_wave_mega_nn.py`: Binary wave neural network implementation using MLXMegaBinary.
- `ember_ml_bitwise_implementation.py`: Implementation plan for adding bitwise operations to Ember ML.

## Binary Wave Operations

The core of binary wave neural networks is the set of binary wave operations:

- **Bitwise Operations**: AND, OR, XOR, NOT
- **Shift Operations**: Left shift, right shift, rotate
- **Wave Operations**: Interference, propagation, duty cycles

These operations are implemented in `mlx_binary_wave.py` using MLX's native operations.

## MegaBinary Implementation

The `mlx_mega_binary.py` file provides a more sophisticated implementation of binary wave operations using the MegaBinary approach from BizarroMath. This implementation supports:

- Arbitrary precision binary operations
- Wave generation and manipulation
- Duty cycle patterns
- Wave interference

## Neural Network Implementations

Two neural network implementations are provided:

1. `binary_wave_nn.py`: A simple implementation using MLX's native operations.
2. `binary_wave_mega_nn.py`: A more sophisticated implementation using MLXMegaBinary.

Both implementations demonstrate how to build neural networks using binary wave operations.

## Examples

### Basic Binary Wave Operations

```python
from mlx_binary_wave import MLXBinaryWave

# Create binary patterns
a = mx.array([0b1010, 0b1100, 0b1111], dtype=mx.int32)
b = mx.array([0b0101, 0b1010, 0b0000], dtype=mx.int32)

# Perform binary operations
c = MLXBinaryWave.bitwise_and(a, b)
d = MLXBinaryWave.bitwise_or(a, b)
e = MLXBinaryWave.bitwise_xor(a, b)

# Create wave patterns
wave = MLXBinaryWave.generate_blocky_sin(mx.array(8), mx.array(2))
```

### Binary Wave Neural Network

```python
from binary_wave_nn import BinaryWaveNetwork

# Create a binary wave neural network
network = BinaryWaveNetwork(input_dim=8, hidden_dim=16, output_dim=4)

# Create input
x = mx.array(mx.random.uniform(shape=(2, 8)) < 0.5, dtype=mx.int32)

# Forward pass
output = network(x)
```

### MegaBinary Operations

```python
from mlx_mega_binary import MLXMegaBinary, InterferenceMode

# Create binary patterns
a = MLXMegaBinary("1010")
b = MLXMegaBinary("0101")

# Perform binary operations
c = a.bitwise_and(b)
d = a.bitwise_or(b)
e = a.bitwise_xor(b)

# Create wave patterns
wave = MLXMegaBinary.generate_blocky_sin(
    MLXMegaBinary("1000"), MLXMegaBinary("10"))
```

### Binary Wave Neural Network with MegaBinary

```python
from binary_wave_mega_nn import BinaryWaveNetwork, create_binary_wave_input

# Create a binary wave neural network
network = BinaryWaveNetwork(input_dim=8, hidden_dim=16, output_dim=4)

# Create input
x = create_binary_wave_input([42, 123])

# Create time step
time_step = MLXMegaBinary("1")

# Forward pass
output = network.forward(x, time_step)
```

## Integration with Ember ML

The `ember_ml_bitwise_implementation.py` file provides a plan for integrating binary wave operations into Ember ML. This integration follows the pattern of the existing linear algebra operations in Ember ML:

1. Define the interface in `ops/interfaces/bitwise_ops.py`
2. Expose the operations in `ops/bitwise/__init__.py`
3. Provide type definitions in `ops/bitwise/__init__.pyi`
4. Implement the operations for each backend (NumPy, PyTorch, MLX)

Once integrated, binary wave operations can be used in Ember ML like any other operation:

```python
from ember_ml import ops
from ember_ml.nn import tensor

# Create tensors
a = tensor.convert_to_tensor([0b1010, 0b1100, 0b1111])
b = tensor.convert_to_tensor([0b0101, 0b1010, 0b0000])

# Perform binary operations
c = ops.bitwise.bitwise_and(a, b)
d = ops.bitwise.bitwise_or(a, b)
e = ops.bitwise.bitwise_xor(a, b)

# Create wave patterns
wave = ops.bitwise.generate_blocky_sin(
    tensor.convert_to_tensor([8]), tensor.convert_to_tensor([2]))
```

## Future Work
