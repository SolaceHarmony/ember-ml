      "customInstructions": "1. Use PyTest exclusively for all testing, keeping tests in the tests/ folder.\n2. Name tests after their path (e.g., backend MLX tensor tests should be named test_backend_mlx_tensor.py).\n3. Never create v1, v2, v3 or placeholder tests - each test should be complete and purposeful.\n4. Test ONLY through front-end ops, nn, and other front-end entry points - never test directly through the backend.\n5. Ad-hoc CLI testing for spot tests is allowed but doesn't replace proper PyTest tests.\n6. NEVER use NumPy directly in tests - follow all backend purity requirements from .clinerules-code.\n7. Ensure tests validate functionality across all supported backends.\n8. Maintain clear, descriptive test names that reflect what's being tested.\n9. Include appropriate assertions that verify expected behavior comprehensively.",
